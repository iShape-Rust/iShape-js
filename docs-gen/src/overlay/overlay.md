![Balloons](balloons.svg)


## Introduction

- The iOverlay is a poly-bool library that supports main operations such as union, intersection, difference, xor, and self-intersection by the even-odd rule.
  
## Features

- **Operations**: union, intersection, difference, and exclusion.
- **Polygons**: with holes, self-intersections, and multiple paths.
- **Simplification**: removes degenerate vertices and merges collinear edges.
- **Buffering**: offsets paths and polygons.
- **Fill Rules**: even-odd, non-zero, positive and negative.
